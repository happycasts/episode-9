```vim
let g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns = ['**/*.h', '**/*.c']
```



useful stuff:

    Example: search only .h and .c files:
    >
            call fuf#setOneTimeVariables(['g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns', ['**/*.h', '**/*.c']])
                  \ | FufCoverageFile
    <
    Example: search your home directory in addition to the default coverage:
    >
            call fuf#setOneTimeVariables(['g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns', g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns + ['~/**/.*', '~/**/*']])
                  \ | FufCoverageFile
